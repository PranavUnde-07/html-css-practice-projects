# 🌐 HTML & CSS Practice Projects

Welcome to my **HTML & CSS Practice Projects** repository! This collection contains 10 beginner-friendly mini projects that I built as part of my ongoing journey into web development. These projects are focused on applying the core concepts of HTML and CSS through hands-on experience, reinforcing what I’ve learned, and building a strong frontend foundation.

This repository is a reflection of my commitment to learning by doing — starting from the basics and gradually improving my design and coding skills one project at a time. Each project is self-contained and structured to demonstrate a particular layout, form, or webpage element, using only HTML and CSS.

As I continue learning, I will update these projects with improvements and add more advanced features over time. I’ll also include **live demo links** so you can instantly view the results in your browser.
