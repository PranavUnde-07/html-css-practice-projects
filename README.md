# 🌱 HTML & CSS Practice Projects

Welcome to my repository of beginner-friendly HTML and CSS projects!  
This repo reflects my progress as starting from the basics and slowly leveling up my frontend skills.

Each project is built using only HTML and CSS

---

## 📚 Why I Created This Repo

As part of my web development learning journey, I wanted to:
- Practice fundamental HTML5 and CSS3 skills
- Build small, real-world UI components and layouts
- Track my progress publicly on GitHub
- Show consistency, discipline, and growth as a developer
